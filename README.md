# Bash Script for Generating Multiplication Table 

This Bash script generates a multiplication table for a number entered by the user. 
The script prompt user to enter a number and then ask if they prefer to see a full multiplication table from 1 to 10. Based on the user's choice, the script will display the corresponding multiplication table. 


The script ask the user to input a number for which the multiplication table will be generated. 


Implemented logic to generate the multiplication table using loops. 

Used if-else statements to handle the logic based on the user's choices (full vs. partial table and valid range inputs)

The user enters valid numbers for the multiplication table and the specified range.

Here i took the input integer variable and print its multiples till 10. At the same time, the loop is used to iterate the loop till the 10th multiple.
